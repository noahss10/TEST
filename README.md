# West East Bridge — GitHub Pages

This folder is ready for **root** deployment on GitHub Pages.

## Use this option if
You want to deploy from the repo root (`main` / root).

## Steps
1) Create a repo and upload **index.html** and **styles.css** (and this README).
2) Go to **Settings → Pages** → **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `main` / **root**
3) Open the URL GitHub shows (usually `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`).

If you instead prefer **docs/** deployment, use the other ZIP included in my reply.
